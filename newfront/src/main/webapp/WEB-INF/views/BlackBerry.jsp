<h1>BlackBerry</h1>

<h4>BlackBerry OS is a proprietary mobile operating system designed specifically for Research In Motion's (RIM) BlackBerry devices. The BlackBerry OS runs on Blackberry variant phones like the BlackBerry Bold, Curve, Pearl and Storm series.</h4>
<h4>The BlackBerry OS is designed for smartphone environments and is best known for its robust support for push Internet email. This push email functionality is carried out through the dedicated BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES), which has versions for Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino and Novell Groupwise.</h4>
<h4>Traditionally, BlackBerry applications are written using Java, particularly the Java Micro Edition (Java ME) platform. However, RIM introduced the BlackBerry Web development platform in 2010, which makes use of the widget software development kit (SDK) to create small standalone Web apps made up of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.</h4>
<h4>There are three ways of installing apps on a BlackBerry OS: downloading an app from BlackBerry App World, over-the-air through the deviceâ€™s built-in browser and via the BlackBerry Desktop Manager.</h4>
